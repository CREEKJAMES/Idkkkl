**Note**: Enabling PRoot Debug Logging will cause performance to become worse.

1) Stop all active sessions and apps.
2) Navigate to the settings page in the UserLAnd app.
3) If the `PRoot Debugging Logs Enabled` setting is not active, activate it.
4) Open the `Debug Verbosity Level` setting and set it to at least 1, but preferably 9.
5) Start a session or app.
6) Once you have finished executing commands in a session, stop the session.
7) Find the log using the steps describing in [Importing and exporting files in UserLAnd](https://github.com/CypherpunkArmory/UserLAnd/wiki/Importing-and-exporting-files-in-UserLAnd) under "Accessing files through an Android file browser".
