**Note**: Enabling PRoot Debug Logging will cause performance to become worse.

1) Navigate to the settings page in the UserLAnd app.
2) If the `PRoot Debugging Logs Enabled` setting is not active, activate it.
3) Open the `Debug Verbosity Level` setting and set it to at least 1, but preferably 9.
4) Retrieve the debug log from `/mnt/sdcard/PRoot_Debug_Log`.
