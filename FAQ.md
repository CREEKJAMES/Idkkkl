1. How do I connect from a device on the same network?

   For ssh, we use port 2022.  So, you can use an ssh client from another device on the same network by connecting to your_phones_ip:2022 .

   For vnc, we use display :51.  So, you can use a vnc client from another device on the same network by connecting you your_phones_ip and specifying the display is :51 or the port is 5951 (depending on what your client needs).
