Our default branch is `master`. When merging feature branches, use the `Squash and merge` option.

Once a release has been prepared, use *merge commits* to merge the release in the `releases` branch. Tag it with a version number of the format v1.0.0 and upload the APK. This will propagate the release to F-Droid. Release manually to the developer console as well.
