To generate test coverage reports, run the gradle task `jacocoCoverageReport`.

This task requires either a connected device to run instrumented tests, or for the instrumented coverage report to have already been generated.

To view the test coverage report, open `app/build/reports/jacoco/jacocoCoverageReport/html/index.html` in a browser.
